# ASP.NET-Demos
A collection of basic MVC excercises.
To be added more over time.
TextSplitter, Chat and MVC are very basic and are only to highlight some design paterns with ASP.NET.
TaskBoard is a somewhat usefull app where users can add, manage and track their tasks. Tasks are sorted as open, ongoing and completed.
It implements a DB with code first approach, 
to use it make sure to use the correct migration(remove the last one if neccesary) and to change the connection string.
More functions will be added over time, next steps are: Manager account which can control every user's task; task urgency/deadlines; email reminders;
